# Ballot Proposal: Decentralization by self-funded subsidized ASIC's.

Proposed ballot entry:

```

It would be in the best interest of Zcash community to preserve the decentralization of its stakeholders 
while prioritizing the benefits that ASIC's offers. Zcash Foundation should, therefore, create a 
non-profit ASIC Program, to research, develop and sell those mining equiptments at cost for the community.

- Agree
- Disagree
