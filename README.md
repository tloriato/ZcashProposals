# Ballot Proposal: Decentralization by self-funded subsidized ASIC's.

Proposed ballot entry:

```

It would be in the best interest of Zcash community to preserve the decentralization of its stakeholders 
while prioritizing the benefits that ASIC's offers. Zcash Foundation should, therefore, create a 
non-profit ASIC Program, to research, develop and sell those mining equiptments at cost for the community.

- Agree
- Disagree
```

## Quick Background into the GPU x ASIC's debate

For the last few weeks the community have been discussing the benefits and trade-offs between enforcing ASIC-resistant algorithms to achieve consensus in the network. The major discussion is happening [here](https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353). Below is a quick summary from stances that I've been reading. I did my best to compile it fairly.

 #### Those in favor of ASIC-resistance argue:
 + GPU mining provides a more fairly<sup>1</sup> environment for the general community 
 + Because of the aforementioned topic, GPU best serves one of the core missions of Zcash (*see: [The Mission](#the-mission)*)
 + It was stated that Zcash would be ASIC-resistant and people have made investments<sup>2</sup> on those assumptions. 
 
 #### Those in against of ASIC-resistance argue:



## The mission

## Proposal
  *This scope of this proposal is left deliberately vague, and does not prescribe a particular action for the Foundation to take. Nor does the outcome indicate a particular technical approach in response. If this proposal is accepted, the Foundation will adopt this as a priority and come up with an action plan to outline in a blogpost.*

### Notes

1: "Fair" is a subjective concept that I've not seen defined by the supporters. So common-sense is required here.  
2: Ranging from buying mining equipments to simply supporting/promoting it because they believe in this vision.
