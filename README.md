# Ballot Proposal: Decentralization by Self-Funded Subsidized ASIC's.

Proposed ballot entry:

```

It would be in the best interest of Zcash community to preserve the decentralization of its stakeholders 
while prioritizing the benefits that ASIC's offers. Zcash Foundation should, therefore, create a 
non-profit ASIC Program, to research, develop and sell those mining equiptments at cost for the community.

- Agree
- Disagree
```

## Quick Background into the GPU X ASIC's Debate

For the last few weeks the community have been discussing the benefits and trade-offs between enforcing ASIC-resistant algorithms to achieve consensus in the network. The major discussion is happening [here](https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353). What follows below is a quick summary from stances that I've been reading. I did my best to compile it fairly.

 #### Those in favor of ASIC-resistance argue:
 + GPU mining provides a more fairly<sup>1</sup> environment for the general community 
 + Because of the aforementioned topic, GPU best serves one of the core missions of Zcash (*see: [The Mission](#the-mission)*)
 + It was stated that Zcash would be ASIC-resistant and people have made investments<sup>2</sup> on those assumptions. 
 
 #### Those against ASIC-resistance argue:
 + ASIC's provide a stronger incentive to support the coin according to Game Theory.
 + By making specialized equipment tied to a specific currency<sup>3</sup>, it becomes more costly to attack the network
 + Permanent ASIC-resistance<sup>4</sup> is not possible, and Hard Forks are risky/costly.
 + Zooko, ZcashCo's CEO, has also [suggested that ASIC's favors decentralization](https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353/151)

## Zcash's Mission

From ZcashCo's [website](https://z.cash/support/faq.html#zcash-mission): 

> Our mission is to create an open, global economic platform from which no-one can be excluded.

This is a bit vague so I'm resorting to Zcash Foundation's mission<sup>5</sup>, which can be read more carefully [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/MISSION.md):

> We support the transition of Zcash into a large and healthy community with diverse stakeholders, held accountable to its userbase in the broadest sense. 


## Proposal
  *The scope of this proposal is left deliberately vague, and does not prescribe a particular action for the Foundation to take. Nor does the outcome indicate a particular technical approach in response. If this proposal is accepted, the Foundation will come up with an action plan to outline in a blogpost or another more specific vote.* 

 This proposal is the result of some thoughts into the debate over the few weeks and the read of an **excellent** [post](https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b). Every citation that follows is from there.

 #### Proposal: 
  The idea of this proposal is to provide an even playing field in the mining sector. By leveraging the self-funded mechanism and the non-profit motivation of the Zcash Foundation, the organization has a special opportunity to foment decentralization and diversification of stakeholders while maintaining and increasing the network's security. 
  To fulfill its mission, the Foundation could bootstrap a R&D departament in order to create open-source blueprints for Zcash's ASICs and, going even further, manufacture and sell those equipments without profit. 

#### Problems with the State of Cryptocurrency Mining:

> The vast majority of ASIC-resistant algorithms were designed by software engineers making assumptions about the limitations of custom hardware. These assumptions tend to be incorrect.

By employing dedicated engineers to this matter, we will be able to factually assert some statements and arrive at more scientifically conclusions.  

>  The Bitmain ASICs are actually substantially less performant (5x to 10x) than our own internal study suggested they would be.

Developing an open-source schematics would leverage more minds between the world around those problems and arrive at better conclusions. It would also prevent companies from selling capped hardwares to customers that would soon be outdated.

 



### Notes

1: "Fair" is a subjective concept that I've not seen defined by the supporters. So common-sense is required here.  
2: Ranging from buying mining equipments to simply supporting/promoting it because they believe in this vision.  
3: Assuming that there isn't two coins (*with the same "relevance"*) with the same algorithm.  
4: In Proof-of-Work systems, PoS is still being researched and might prove to be a good option in the future.     
5: It isn't very clear, yet, how they might differ, but I'd assume the same core values.
